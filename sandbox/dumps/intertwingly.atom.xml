It does this by downloading all of the provided reports and\n  collating them with comments, prior comments, action items, minutes, links to\n  prior reports, links to committee information, and the like.  It provides a UI\n  to allow Directors and guests to enter comments.  It provides a UI to allow\n  the Secretary to take minutes.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The tool itself is built using\n  <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React.JS</a>.  It starts by\n  downloading all of the reports.  Navigation between reports can be done via\n  mouse clicks or cursor keys and doesn't involve any server interaction.  As\n  new data is received, the window is updated.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Finally, I'm new to Service Workers so I may be doing things in a profoundly\n  dumb way.  Any pointers would be appreciated.  I am capable of RTFM and\n  following examples.\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"caching-json\">First step - caching JSON</h3>\n\n<p>\n  Some of the data (e.g., the list of ASF JIRA projects) is fetched on demand.\n  Generally the page is first rendered using an empty list, and then updated\n  once the actual list is received.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  This process could be improved by caching the results received and using that\n  data until fresh data arrives.  As the Cache API is built on promises, and\n  therefore asynchronous, this generally means rendering three times: once with\n  a empty list, then with the cache, and finally with live data.\n</p>\n\n<pre><span style=\"background-color:hsla(300,100%,50%,0.06)\"><span style=\"color:#404\">/</span><span style=\"color:#404\">/</span></span> retrieve an cached object.

Doesn't involve the activation of Service Workers, but it\n  doesn't have to.\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"caching-html\">Second step - caching HTML</h3>\n\n<p>\n  What's true for JSON should also be true for HTML.  Prior to the caching\n  logic introduced above, and continuing to be true for browsers that don't\n  support the service workers caching interface, data that should appear on the\n  page would be missing briefly and show up a second or two later.  In the case\n  of HTML, that data would be the entire page.  This would typically be seen\n  both on the initial page load as well as any time a link is opened in a new\n  tab.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  The HTML case is both simpler and more difficult.  Fetching the HTML from\n  cache and then replacing it wholesale from the network, while possible, would\n  be jarring.  Fortunately, there already is logic in place to update the\n  content of the pages based on updates received by XHR.  So initially\n  displaying where the user last left off, as well as updating the cache,\n  is sufficient.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Unfortunately, it isn't quite so simple.  I've included the current code below\n  complete with log statements and dead ends.\n</p>\n\n<pre><span style=\"background-color:hsla(300,100%,50%,0.06)\"><span style=\"color:#404\">/</span><span

requires authentication to\n  use as the data presented may contain Apache Software Foundation confidential\n  information.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Without accounting for this, what often would be placed into the cache would\n  be the HTTP <code>401</code> challenge response.  That's not desirable.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Attempting to force the return of a challenge when an Authorization header is not present results in the display of the challenge response.  Again, not what we want.\n</p>\n<p>\n  Falling back to only providing the cached data when the Authorization header\n  is present (and matches the one used for the cache) results in the cache being\n  used sometimes with Firefox.  And, unfortunately, never with Chrome.\n</p>\n<p>\n  A secondary problem, of lesser importance, is that the cache never gets\n  updated if the service worker responds with a cache copy.  Of if it does,\n  the <code>console.log</code> messages aren't getting executed or aren't\n  producing output.\n</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"monitoring\">Third step - monitoring</h3>\n\n<p>\n  To help with debugging, it occurred to me that it would make sense to produce\n  a page that shows Service Worker and Cache status.\n</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      For service workers, there was no problems, but the results were\n      underwhelming.  I only got information back about my service worker even\n      though I had several activated by this point by virtue of running\n      various demos.  That's not a problem, as that's all I needed.  The only\n      information I could get was the state of the service worker.  But even\n      so, I could use this as a building block to enable users to send a\n      message to the service worker and/or unregister it.  See plans below for\n      more details.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      For caches, I simply couldn't get it to work.  For example, I tried\n      adding the following line immediate after the <code>cache.put</code>\n      line in the first code snippet:\n    </p>\n    <pre>console.log cache.keys()</pre>\n    <p>\n      The result was an empty list (<code>[]</code>) on both Firefox and\n      Chrome.  This is problematic on a number of levels, not the least of\n      which being that the interface is defined to return a promise and Arrays\n      in JavaScript don't respond to then.\n    </p>\n    <p>References:</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://slightlyoff.github.io/ServiceWorker/spec/service_worker/#cache-keys\">Service Workers Nightly</a>\n      </li>\n      <li>\n        <a href=\"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Cache/keys\">Cache.keys() - Web APIs | MDN</a>\n      </li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3 id=\"plans\">Plans</h3>\n\n<p>\n  One thing I haven't explored yet is replacing the fetch call with one with\n  different values for the request mode and credentials mode.  I figured I would\n  ask for guidance before proceeding down that path.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  Once caching HTML is mastered, caching related artifacts like stylesheets and\n  javascripts would be in order.  An online fallfack approach would likely be\n  the best match.\n</p>\n\n<p>\n  After that, the next order of business would be queuing of updates while\n  offline.  While in general, that would be a hard problem, in this case as user\n  operations are limited by role and generaally to editing their own changes,\n  it should be manageable.\n</p></div>",

But even\n      so, I could use this as a building block to enable users to send a\n      message to the service worker and/or unregister it.  See plans below for\n      more details.\n    "],

web applications is Model, View, Controller.\u00A0 Early versions of this tool was not written that way: it was a CGI script that grew like a weed.\u00A0 Over time, some <a

href=\"http://getbootstrap.com/\">Bootstrap</a>.\u00A0 These frameworks enabled me to do things I had never done before.\u00A0 It also required me to write code that watched for changes, and to ensure that changes were applied in place (specifically arrays and hashes could not be replaced, they had to be updated).</p>\n<p>While Angular.js used terms like Directives, Filters, and Services, the overall effect was to impose a structure on the client side application.\u00A0 As with most things, this structure was both constraining and freeing.</p>\n<p>The current rewrite replaces Angular.js with <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/\">React.js</a>.\u00A0 Gone is all watches and the need to update things in place.\u00A0 In its place is a policy of \u201Crerender everything\u201D whenever an event (a keystroke, a mouse click, a server side event) occurs.\u00A0 With React.JS, rerendering everything is efficient as React computes a delta and then only applies the delta to the DOM.\u00A0 React.JS does provide a suggested architecture, namely Flux, that minimizes the need to rerender everything, but in practice I have not found that necessary.</p>\n<p>To illustrate, if you bring up the \u201CCall to order\u201D page and press and hold down the right arrow key, every page of the agenda will be flashed up and promptly replaced.</p>\n<p>The overall resulting flow is as follows: when a page is fetched the response starts out with a pre-rendered representation (simple HTML), followed by the scripts needed to produce that page, followed by the data used by those scripts.\u00A0 This ensures that the data is presented promptly, then become reactive to input and events.</p>\n<p>The resulting architecture isn\u2019t MVC on either the client or the server.\u00A0 Instead, V and C get mushed together, and a unified client/server event stream is added.</p>\n<p>Events are received from the server using <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/eventsource/\">Server Sent Events</a>.\u00A0 This is <a href=\"http://caniuse.com/#feat=eventsource\">widely implemented</a>, and has a solid <a href=\"https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource/\">polyfill</a> for browsers (most notably, IE) that haven\u2019t implemented this standard.\u00A0 Its one way data flow is a good fit for React.js.</p>\n<p>Events are generally triggered by actions on a client browser window somewhere (typically a mouse click) resulting in a HTTP GET or POST request being sent to the server, but can also be triggered by file system changes on the server (example: a cron job does a svn update, which causes the agenda to contain new data).</p>\n<p>A single event-stream is maintained per browser, and that process is responsible for propagating updates to all tabs and windows.\u00A0 Events can be sent to all clients, or only clients authenticated with a given user id.\u00A0 This enables my pending updates to be immediately reflected on all of my tabs and windows but not affect others.\u00A0 The result of an event is to update one or more models, and then trigger a re-render.</p>\n<p>Models on both the client and server are simple classes.\u00A0 Class methods operate on the entity as a whole (example: write the whole agenda to disk on the server, or provide an index for the agenda on the client).\u00A0 Instance methods refer to an individual item (example: an agenda item).</p>\n<p>What\u2019s left is React Components on the client and actions on the server.</p>\n<p>React components have a render method.\u00A0 That method has full (read-only) access to client models, and can do if statements, iterate over result, and (generally minor) computations.\u00A0 More extensive computations should be refactored to other methods in the component when limited in scope to a single component, or to the client model otherwise.\u00A0 The one limitation that is enforced is that render methods can not directly or indirectly change state.\u00A0 A predefined <a href=\"https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/component-specs.html\">life-cycle</a> is defined.\u00A0 Other methods can be added, for example methods to handle onClick events.</p>\n<p>These methods can trigger HTTP POST and GET requests (the convenience method I provide for the latter is called fetch instead).\u00A0 These run small scripts on the server that may update models, generate events, and return JSON.</p>\n<p>Taken together, the current implementation is a lot more fun to develop and easier to maintain than prior versions.\u00A0 As an example, if it were decided that the moment the secretary clicked the \u2018timestamp` button on the 'Call to order\u2019 page, all comment buttons are to be removed from all windows and all comment modal dialogs are to be closed, this could be implemented using a single if statement as the event is already propagated, and a re-render is already triggered.\u00A0 All that would be required is to change the conditions under which the comment button appears.</p>\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/rubys/whimsy-agenda#readme\">board agenda tool</a> has been tested on Linux, Mac OS/X, Vagrant, and Docker.\u00A0 It contains a suite of tests.</p></div>",

The code compiles one-to-one into the equivalent JS, and there is no interpretation at runtime.\u00A0 You can use any existing JavaScript library seamlessly from Ruby2JS (and vice-versa). The compiled output is readable and pretty-printed, will work in every JavaScript runtime, and tends to run as fast or faster than the equivalent handwritten JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Now I don\u2019t expect to have the success or <a href=\"https://twitter.com/raganwald/status/555386257233027073\">impact</a> that CoffeeScript has had.\u00A0 But I can say that I\u2019m having fun.\u00A0 And in the process, I\u2019m seeing the benefits with applications I write.</p></div>",

<a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3986.txt\">RFC 3986</a> complaint.\u00A0 I\u2019d like to fix that.</p>\n<p> - - -</p>\n<p>Let\u2019s talk a bit about nomenclature.</p>\n<p>On the web, particularly in places like values of attributes named <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/links.html#links-created-by-a-and-area-elements\">href</a>, there are things that people have, at various times, attempted to call <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_resource_locator\">web addresses</a> or <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3987.txt\">IRIs</a>.\u00A0 Neither term has stuck.\u00A0 In common uses these are called <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/\">URLs</a>.</p>\n<p>In between the markup and servers, there are user agents.\u00A0 One such user agent is a browser.\u00A0 Browsers don\u2019t passively send URLs along, they reject some outright, and transform others.\u00A0 There should be a name for the set of outputs of the various cleanups that browsers perform.</p>\n<p>Since browsers are programmable, you can directly observe this transformation.\u00A0 The WHATWG URL specification defines an <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#api\">API</a> which has already been implemented by Firefox and Chrome, and is being evaluated by Microsoft and Apple.\u00A0 Create a JavaScript console and enter the following:</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">new URL(\"hTtP:/EXamPLe.COM/\").href</pre>\n<p>The output you will see is:</p>\n<pre class=\"code\">\"http://example.com/\"</pre>\n<p>The output is clearly much cleaner and more consistent than the input.\u00A0 In fact, in this case the output is RFC 3986 compliant.</p>\n<p>Unfortunately, in the general case, this isn\u2019t true.\u00A0 Browsers (and more generally: other libraries like the ones found in pretty much every modern programming language) can produce things that aren\u2019t RFC 3986 compliant.</p>\n<p>I\u2019m <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/interop/test-results/\">looking</a> at every browser and every library I can.\u00A0 I\u2019m specifically looking for differences.\u00A0 In some cases, I\u2019m pointing out where such outputs are clearly wrong and need to be fixed.</p>\n<p>In other cases, the output may not be RFC 3986 compliant, but actually are useful and actually work.\u00A0 What this means in practice is that the set of things that consumers need to be able to correctly process is not defined by RFC 3986 but by these tools.</p>\n<p>People can learn this the hard way by starting out to implement RFC 3986 and then finding that they need to reverse engineer other tools.\u00A0 We can do better.\u00A0 We can set out to update RFC 3986 or otherwise document what the actual set of inputs that can be expected to interoperably process is.</p>\n<p>In general, I have found that it isn\u2019t difficult to talk about places where RFC 3986 can be tightened up.\u00A0 Where there has been push-back is exploring any notion of loosening the definition.\u00A0 The reaction generally is expressed along the lines of \u201Cdoing so would break things\u201D.</p>\n<p>I can see how some see such a position as reasonable.\u00A0 I don\u2019t, and I\u2019ll tell you why.\u00A0 What is effectively being said is that documenting how things actually work will break things, which is clearly untrue.</p>\n<p>What such an effort will do is not break things, but uncover uncomfortable truths.\u00A0 To build upon an <a href=\"http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/apps-discuss/current/msg13827.html\">example</a> from Dave Cridland, one such uncomfortable truth may be that the sets of things that everybody except LDAP schemas can handle is different than the sets of things LDAP schemas can handle.</p>\n<p>There are three ways to handle that.\u00A0 One would be to change everybody to conform to what LDAP can handle.\u00A0 One would be to change LDAP.\u00A0 And one would be to document clearly that the set of things LDAP can handle and the set of things that everybody else expects to be handled are separate sets.\u00A0 Largely overlapping, yes, but not identical sets.</p>\n<p>While documenting three sets (the set of things Chrome and other browser supports, the set of things HTTP and other protocols support, and the set of things LDAP supports) would not be my first choice, but it may be the only option available given the constraints.</p>\n<p>If you look at those three sets, ideally each would be a proper subset of these that precede it.\u00A0 That\u2019s not currently the case at the moment, but as I mentioned proposals made with clear rationale provided to tighten up RFC 3986 don\u2019t seem to be getting much push-back.</p>\n<p>What we need then it three names.\u00A0 URIs seem to be the obvious choice for name of the set of \u201Cthings LDAP schemas support\u201D.\u00A0 For better or worse, URLs seem to be the name that has stuck for the first set.</p>\n<p>At this point, a number of people seeing an opening suggest IRIs as the name for the set in the middle.\u00A0 Um, no.\u00A0 Except for fragments, this set is 100% pure ASCII.\u00A0 The name for what IRIs attempted to define is URLs.</p>\n<p>So this means that we need to define a new name.\u00A0 That\u2019s not so bad, is it?\u00A0 It could be worse, at least we don\u2019t have to define a <a href=\"http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TwoHardThings.html\">cache invalidation</a> strategy.</p></div>",

The first change\nI landed was to convert the spec from <a href=\"https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Anolis\">Anolis</a> to <a href=\"https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed#readme\">Bikeshed</a>.  Here\u2019s the\n<a href=\"https://rawgit.com/whatwg/url/8be4726f53/url.html\">before</a> and\nafter <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/whatwg/url/bd3f0ce38f/url.html\">after</a>.\nAnd just for fun, here is <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/whatwg/url/232157a284/url.html\">the beginning on\n2014</a> and <a href=\"https://rawgit.com/whatwg/url/bdaff0591b/url.html\">beginning of 2013</a>.\nThe point being that arbitrary snapshots of living standards do exist.</p>\n\n<p>Along the way, I\u2019ve been named by my employer\u2019s AC member to be a member of\nthe <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/\">W3C WebApps Working Group</a>,\nand invited to become a member of the <a href=\"https://whatwg.org/\">WHATWG</a>\norganization on GitHub.\nI\u2019ve been named as co-editor of the spec in both organizations, and at that\npoint the fun abruptly stopped.  Apparently, the larger political issues that I\nhad successfully avoided in the past moved front and center.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what I <a href=\"http://intertwingly.net/blog/2014/09/16/The-URL-Mess\">said in\nSeptember</a>:</p>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>While I am optimistic that at some point in the future the W3C will\n  feel comfortable referencing stable and consensus driven specifications\n  produced by the WHATWG, it is likely that some changes will be required to\n  one or both organizations for this to occur; meanwhile I encourage the W3C\n  to continue on the path of standardizing a snapshot version of the WHATWG\n  URL specification, and for HTML5 to reference the W3C version of the\n  specification.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Now it is time for me to spell out how I see that happening.</p>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll start out by saying that I continue to want the WebApps WG to follow\nthrough on its <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2014/06/webapps-charter.html#deliverables\">charter\nobligation</a> to continue to publish updates to the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/TR/url/\">URL Working Draft</a>.  And once updates\nresume, I want to work on making doing so entirely unnecessary.  While this may\nsound puzzling, there is a method to my madness.  I want to establish an\nenvironment where an open discussion of this matter can be held without anybody\nfeeling that there are options that are closed to them or that there is a gun\nto their head.</p>\n\n<p>Next I\u2019ll state an observable fact: there exists people who value the output\nof the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/\">W3C process</a>.  The\nfact that there are people who don\u2019t doesn\u2019t make the first set of people go\naway or become any less important.  Note that I said the output of the W3C\nprocess.  People who value that don\u2019t necessarily (or even generally) want to\nobserve or participate in the making of the sausage.</p>\n\n<p>What they value instead is <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2014Nov/0000.html\">regular\nreleases and making the bleeding edge publicly available</a>.  And for\nreleases, what they care most about are the items that are covered during a\nW3C Transition (<a href=\"http://www.w3.org/html/wg/cr/html5/transition-request.html\">example</a>).\nIn particular, they are interested in evidence of wide review, evidence that\nissues have been addressed, evidence that there are implementations, and the\nIPR commitments that are captured along the way.</p>\n\n<p>Some have (and do) argue that these needs can be met in other ways.  Not\neverybody is convinced of this.  I\u2019m not convinced.  In particular, the\nexistence of a bugzilla database with numerous bugs closed as WORKS4ME\nwithout explanation doesn\u2019t satisfy me.</p>\n\n<p>To date, those needs have intentionally not been met by the WHATWG.  And\nan uneasy arrangement has been created where specs have been republished at\nthe W3C with additional editors listed, in many cases in name only.  Those\ncopies were then shepherded through the W3C process.  Many are not happy\nwith this process.  I personally can live with it, but I\u2019d rather not.</p>\n\n<p>I said that this will require changes by one or both organizations.  I\nwill now say that I expect this to require cooperation and changes by both.\nI\u2019ll start by describing the changes I feel are needed by the WHATWG, of\nwhich there are three.</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Agree to the production of planned snapshots.  And by that I mean\n    byte-for-byte copies.  As a part of this that would mean the\n    identification of \"items at risk\" at early stages of the process, and\n    the potential removal of these items later in the process.  These\n    snapshots will need to meet the needs of the W3C, primarily <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/07/pubrules\">pubrules</a>,\n    and only linking to W3C approved references.  Even though it should have\n    to go without saying, <a href=\"https://whatwg.org/specs/url/2014-07-30/\">apparently it needs to\n    be said</a>: those specs need to be snark free.  Finally I'll go further\n    and suggest that those snapshots be hosted by the W3C, much in the way\n    that the W3C hosts WHATWG's bugzilla database and mailing list\n    archives.</p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n    <p>Participation in the production of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/08/01-transitions.html#transreq\">Transition\n    Requests</a>.  That would involve providing evidence of wide review and\n    evidence that issues are addressed.  It also could include, but doesn't\n    necessary require, direct participation in the transition calls.  \n    </p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n    <p>Understanding and internalizing the notion that the combination of an\n    open license coupled with begin unwilling or unable to address a\n    perceived need by others is a valid reason for a fork.  Yes, I know that\n    the W3C hasn't adopted an open license themselves, and I believe that is\n    wrong too.  But that doesn't change the fact that an open license plus\n    an unmet need is sufficient justification for a fork.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I\u2019ll close my discussion on the WHATWG changes I envision with a statement\nthat participation in the W3C process (to the extent described by #1 and #2\nabove) is optional and will likely be done on a spec by spec basis.  Editors of\nsome WHATWG specs may not chose not to participate in this process, and that\u2019s\nOK, I simply ask that those that don\u2019t recognize the implications of this\nchoice (specifically #3 above).</p>\n\n<p>Responsibility for advancing specs for which the WHATWG editors\nvoluntarily elect to participate in the process would fall to a sponsoring\nW3C Working Group.  Starting to sponsor, ceasing to sponsor, and forking a\nspec would require explicit W3C Working Group decisions.  As a general rule,\nWorking Groups should only consider sponsoring focused, modular\nspecifications.</p>\n\n<p>Here\u2019s what sponsoring would (and most importantly, would <em>not</em>)\ninvolve:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>\n      No editing.  As suggested above, snapshots produced by the WHATWG\n      would be archived, but these archives would be byte-for-byte beyond\n      the changes involved in archiving itself (example: updating stylesheet\n      links to point to captured snapshots of stylesheets).  The one\n      possible exception to this would be in the updating of normative\n      references, but this would only be done with the concurrence of the\n      WHATWG editors.\n    </p>\n  </li>\n\n  <li>\n    <p>Participation would be limited to the production of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/08/01-transitions.html#transreq\">Transition\n    Requests</a>.  This would include providing evidence of <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#wide-review\">wide\n    review</a>, evidence that issues are <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#formal-address\">formally\n    addressed</a>, <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2014/Process-20140801/#WGArchiveMinorityViews\">recording\n    and reporting of Formal Objections</a>, collecting patent <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy-20040205/#sec-Disclosure\">disclosures</a>,\n    etc.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>That\u2019s it.  Of course, the process will remain the same for documents that\nare copied and shepherded instead, but I see no reason that <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/\">WebApps WG</a> couldn't sponsor the\nWHATWG <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/\">URL standard</a> through this\nprocess, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/html/wg/\">HTML WG</a> couldn't do the\nsame for the <a href=\"https://dom.spec.whatwg.org/\">DOM standard</a>, the <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/International/core/\">I18N WG</a> couldn't do the same\nfor the <a href=\"https://encoding.spec.whatwg.org/\">Encoding standard</a>,\netc.</p>\n\n<p>While everybody may come into a sponsorship collaboration with the best\nintentions, we need to realize that things may not always go as planned.\nThere may be disagreements.  It has been known to happen.  When such\noccurs:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Everyone involved should work very hard to resolve the dispute as\nthe consequence of breakage is very bad all around.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If no agreement can be reached, the W3C Working Group will likely\nstop the sponsorship of the specific spec involved in the dispute.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>If a Working Group stops sponsoring a spec, the Working Group could\nstill fork that spec - but that would be a suboptimal solution for both W3C and\nWHATWG.  It would also re-inflame the debates between organizations.</p></li>\n\n<li><p>Nonetheless, since each organization has different criteria, we must\nrecognize that this could happen; especially for large, broad, complex\nspecs.  Accordingly it makes sense for both organizations to continue the\ntrend towards smaller and more modular specifications</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>I have no idea if others are willing to go along with this, but I hope\nthat this concrete proposal helps anchor this discussion.  I invite others\nthat are inclined to do so to suggest revisions or to create proposals of\ntheir own.  As an example, since the above describes an environment of\ncollaboration and sharing of work, perhaps co-branding may be worth\nexploring?</p>\n\n<p>This clearly will take time.  As an editor of the URL specification, I\u2019d\nlike to propose that it be the first test of this proposal.  In the\nmeanwhile, I plan to spend my time coding.</p>\n\n<p>For those that wish to dig further, a few links:</p>\n\n<small><ul>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/10/decision-by-consensus-or-by-informed-editor-which-is-better/\">http://www.w3.org/blog/2014/10/decision-by-consensus-or-by-informed-editor-which-is-better/</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2014Nov/0023.html\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/www-archive/2014Nov/0023.html</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014OctDec/0437.html\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014OctDec/0437.html</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#acknowledgments\">https://url.spec.whatwg.org/#acknowledgments</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014JulSep/0492.html\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014JulSep/0492.html</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Nov/0000.html\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-whatwg-archive/2014Nov/0000.html</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014OctDec/0315.html\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-webapps/2014OctDec/0315.html</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2014Nov/0036.html\">http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-html-admin/2014Nov/0036.html</a>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <a href=\"http://intertwingly.net/blog/2014/10/02/WHATWG-URL-vs-IETF-URI\">http://intertwingly.net/blog/2014/10/02/WHATWG-URL-vs-IETF-URI</a>\n  </li>\n</ul></small></div>",
