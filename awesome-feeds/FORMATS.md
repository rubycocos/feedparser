### Collection+JSON

See [Collection+JSON - Hypermedia Type](http://amundsen.com/media-types/collection/)

Collection+JSON is a JSON-based read/write hypermedia-type designed to support management and querying of simple collections. It is similar to the The Atom Syndication Format (RFC4287) and the The Atom Publishing Protocol (RFC5023) . However, Collection+JSON defines both the format and the semantics in a single media type. It also includes support for Query Templates and expanded write support through the use of a Write Template.




## YAML Feed (†)

- [YAMLFeed @ Indie Web](https://indieweb.org/YAMLFeed) (twitter: [yamlfeed](https://twitter.com/yamlfeed)) - Launched as a "practical" lulz joke - keep the formats wars (eg. rss vs atom) alive (e.g. now json vs yaml).
